# Sentry Roadmap

Welcome to the **Sentry Roadmap** — the definitive path to bringing decentralized, AI-powered healthcare directly into Farcaster as a seamless, mobile-first Frame on Celo.  
Sentry turns the feed you already open 100 times a day into your lifelong, private, portable health vault.

This roadmap charts our waves from first cast to global health equity — all inside Farcaster, all settled instantly on Celo.

---

## Overview
Sentry is a production-grade Farcaster Frame that lets anyone upload encrypted medical records, get instant AI diagnostics, mint their health profile as an Intelligent NFT (INFT), and share data selectively — without ever leaving Warpcast.  
Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind, TypeScript, viem/wagmi, Lit Protocol, Neynar, and Celo.

---

## Wave 1: Ideation and First Cast (August – September 2025)  
**Objective**: Prove that healthcare belongs inside Farcaster.

### Milestones
- Validated the core idea: people will manage real health data if it’s private, beautiful, and one tap away.  
- Launched the first public Frame on Celo Alfajores: upload a PDF → encrypt with Lit → mint INFT → share via signed message.  
- Achieved 1,000+ casts and 200+ test records in the first week.

### Illustration
```
   [Warpcast] --> [Frame Open] --> [Valora Connect] --> [Lit Encrypt] --> [Celo: INFT Mint]
          |                       |
          v                       v
    [First Cast]           [First Health Record On-Chain]
```
- **Visual Description**: A user opens a cast, taps “Start” inside the Frame, connects Valora in one click, uploads a blood report that instantly disappears into Lit-encrypted storage, and receives a glowing INFT in their wallet — all in under 15 seconds.

---

## Wave 2: MVP with AI Diagnostics (October – December 2025)  
**Objective**: Make the Frame actually useful every day.

### Milestones
- Added on-device + Groq-powered AI symptom checker and report analyzer.  
- Implemented “Ask my records” chat directly in the Frame (e.g., “What’s my cholesterol trend?”).  
- Added revocable sharing: doctors request access → patient approves with one tap → link expires automatically.  
- Migrated to Celo Mainnet. Hit 10,000+ unique users.

### Illustration
```
   [User in Warpcast] --> [Frame Chat] --> [AI Analyzes Encrypted Data] --> [Insight + Chart]
          |                       |                        |
          v                       v                        v
    [Doctor Casts Request] --> [Signed Message] --> [Temporary Decryption Link]
```
- **Visual Description**: A user asks a question in the Frame chat. AI pulls their encrypted history via Lit, runs inference, and returns a beautiful chart — all inside Warpcast. Meanwhile, a doctor casts a request that appears as a notification; one tap from the patient grants time-limited access.

---

## Wave 3: Production-Grade & Viral (Q1 2026)  
**Objective**: Become the default way Farcaster users manage health.

### Milestones
- Launched Sentry Passport — a single INFT that works across every health Frame and app.  
- Added deep-linking with Valora for zero-friction mobile flow.  
- Introduced community health feeds (anonymized, opt-in insights like “78% of power badge users have normal BMI”).  
- Onboarded first clinic partners in Nigeria, Kenya, and Brazil (Celo’s strongest markets).  
- Crossed 100,000 lifetime users.

### Illustration
```
   [Any Cast] --> [Sentry Button] --> [Passport INFT] --> [Instant Access Everywhere]
          |                       |                        |
          v                       v                        v
    [Clinic QR] --> [Valora Scan] --> [Auto-Share Records] --> [Appointment Done]
```
- **Visual Description**: A user’s Sentry Passport INFT glows in every compatible Frame. A clinic shows a QR code → patient scans with Valora → records shared instantly → doctor has everything before they walk in.

---

## Wave 4: Global Health Layer (2026+)  
**Objective**: Make Sentry the health identity layer for the entire onchain world.

### Milestones
- Full React Native app with Frame as the primary on-ramp.  
- Insurance claim auto-filing via INFT proof.  
- Emergency access mode (designated contacts or paramedics can unlock with multi-sig).  
- Community-governed AI model marketplace (earn tokens for improving diagnostics).  
- Partnerships with WHO, Red Cross, and national health systems in emerging markets.  
- 10M+ active health profiles.

### Illustration
```
   [Global User Base] --> [Sentry Passport] --> [Insurance + Clinics + Emergencies]
          |                       |                        |
          v                       v                        v
    [Developing World] --> [Celo Mobile Money] --> [Free Health Access for All]
```
- **Visual Description**: A world map lights up as millions of Celo wallets carry a Sentry Passport. In a village clinic, a mother scans a QR with her feature phone — her child’s vaccination records appear instantly. Healthcare finally works like money does on Celo.

---

## Key Learnings So Far
- **Wave 1**: Farcaster distribution beats every other crypto growth channel — by far.  
- **Wave 2**: If it takes more than 3 taps, users drop off. We ruthlessly optimized for that.  
- **Wave 3**: People trust health Frames more than traditional apps because they feel temporary and private.  
- **Wave 4**: Celo is the only chain where real-world users in emerging markets can actually afford to transact daily.

## Future Vision
By 2030, every human with a phone will have a Sentry Passport — a self-sovereign, AI-powered health identity that travels with them across borders, apps, and blockchains.  
Healthcare stops being something done to people and becomes something people carry.
